#Wedication

This is the barebones of a website/scripts that I used to automate portions of my wedding via SMS:
*initial 'save the date' notifications
*capturing responses from guests to R.S.V.P's
*general notifications (website going live)
*chasing guests for food choices
*statistics on registration/food choices
